Arguments

There can be no arguments to objtype or it can have one or multiple conditions in the following format:

{ field | * attribute [ <space> ] } [ modifiers ] = value

Where:

field is a documented field of the object.

attribute is the name of an extensible attribute. Must be prefixed by an asterisk (*) and optionally followed by a single space.

modifiers is optional and can be one or more search modifiers supported by the field or extensible attribute value type.

value is the value or regular expression to search for.

When combining multiple conditions, all must be satisified in order to match an object (i.e. conditions are combined with AND).

When a field is a list or an extensible attribute that can have multiple values, the condition is true if any value in the list matches.

If no modifiers are used, it is an exact match.

Search Modifiers

A search argument can use the following modifiers:

Modifier    Functionality
!    Negates the condition.
:    Makes string matching case insensitive.
~    Regular expression search. Expressions are unanchored.
<    Less than or equal.
>    Greater than or equal.
Only one of the following can be specified at one time: greater than, less than, and regular expressions.

You can find the modifiers that are supported by each field in the respective documentation. Unsupported combinations will result in an error.

Depending on the attribute type, following are modifiers supported by extensible attributes:

integer and date support !, < and >. All other types behave like strings and support !, ~ and :.
