regex is really a "contains" option
ipv4addr is likely not needed since it seems to work identically to network


network_view	=	exact text

comment		=	exact text
comment		:=	case insensitive text (exact string)
comment		~=	regex (partial string matching / not full regex)
comment		~:=	case insensitive / regex

ipv4addr	=	exact IP
ipv4addr	~=	regex

network		=	exact IP/mask
network		~=	regex

network_container	=	exact IP/mask

unmanaged	=	0 (no) or 1 (yes)

contains_address	=	exact IP
			(only works with network_view, all others ignored)

member		=	dhcpmember,ipv4address[,name]
member		=	ipv6dhcpmember,ipv6address[,name]
member		=	msdhcpserver,ipv4address

*EA_NAME	=	case sensitive match
*EA_NAME	:=	case insensitive match
*EA_NAME	~=	case sensitive match / contains
*EA_NAME	~:=	case insensitive match / contains
